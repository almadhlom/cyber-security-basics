## Introduction
------------

Cyber Security Basics is a comprehensive guide to understanding the fundamental concepts of cyber security. This project aims to provide a clear and concise overview of the key principles and practices that can help individuals and organizations protect themselves against cyber threats.

## Prerequisites
------------

* Basic knowledge of computer systems and networking
* Familiarity with operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* Understanding of basic security concepts (passwords, firewalls, antivirus software)

## Installation
------------

To install Cyber Security Basics, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyber-security-basics.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

This project does not require any dependencies. However, if you want to run the example code, you will need to install Python 3.x and the `requests` library.

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage
-----

Once you have installed the project, you can run the example code to see how the concepts are applied in practice.

### Example Code

```python
import requests

def send_request(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        print(response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(e)

url = "https://www.example.com"
send_request(url)
```

## Security Best Practices
-------------------------

### Password Management

* Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
* Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts
* Use a password manager to securely store and generate passwords

### Network Security

* Use a firewall to block unauthorized incoming and outgoing traffic
* Enable encryption for all network communications
* Regularly update and patch operating systems and software

### Data Protection

* Use encryption to protect sensitive data
* Regularly back up data to a secure location
* Use secure protocols (HTTPS, SFTP) for data transfer

## Troubleshooting
--------------

### Common Issues

* **Connection Refused**: Check that the firewall is not blocking the connection
* **Authentication Failed**: Check that the username and password are correct
* **Data Corruption**: Check that the data is being transferred securely

### Debugging Tools

* Use a debugger to step through the code and identify issues
* Use a network sniffer to analyze network traffic
* Use a logging tool to track errors and exceptions

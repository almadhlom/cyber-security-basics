```python
# Simple password strength checker
password = "mypassword123"

# Check password strength using enumerate for index and value
for index, char in enumerate(password, start=1):  # Start index from 1 for readability
    # Check if password length is less than 8
    if len(password) < 8:
        print(f"Password is weak at position {index} with character '{char}'")
    else:
